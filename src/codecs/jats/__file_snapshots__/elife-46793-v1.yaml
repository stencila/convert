        promoters and 5’ UTRs of highly transcribed genes, including
        cancer-related genes and regions of somatic copy number alteration. G4s
        may therefore be part of a regulatory mechanism to switch between
        different transcriptional states. At telomeres, tandem G4-repeat
        structures also may help protect chromosome ends by providing binding

        resolved by helicases to allow replication and transcription to proceed.
        Several helicases, including WRN, BLM, PIF1, DHX36 and RTEL1, have been

Two general outcomes are possible: a gene is not required in a G4-dependent process so there is no effect on cell viability\_(left); or gene silencing results in cell death either due to loss of a direct G4 interaction (e.g. binding/unwinding) or indirectly through gene loss in a G4-dependent pathway\_(right).

        In dropout screens, dissociating minor from robust growth effects is
        important and is highly dependent on parameters such as compound dose,
        genotype and cell line selected. Our screen was designed with stringent
        parameters to detect genes deficiencies worthy of further exploration.
        Indeed, we demonstrate potent growth inhibition of up to 80% of the four
        top G4 sensitisers genes in a parallel siRNA approach.

        The gene sensitivities uncovered here have potential to be exploited
        chemotherapeutically in cancer by deploying a G4-stabilising drug as a
        single-agent therapy. Alternatively, in the absence of a particular gene
        deficiency, pharmacological inhibition of a critical oncogene could
        phenocopy the genetic sensitivities described here and be used in
        combinatorial treatments with G4-stabilising drugs. This may be
        attractive as cells are less likely to simultaneously develop resistance
        against two drugs (reviewed in

        ). Furthermore, as lower drug doses are used, this increases the
        therapeutic window and has less adverse side effects. As
        proof-as-principle for this, we selected the WEE1 cell cycle kinase and
        the deubiquitinase USP1, and demonstrated that their pharmacological
        inhibition, with MK1775 and pimozide, respectively, leads to the
        potentiation of cell death in conjunction with the G4 ligand PDS. For
        example, 5.3 μM PDS or 6.25 μM pimozide alone impart little growth
        inhibition (14% and 6% respectively), but together they lead to strong
        growth inhibition (79%).

      - "While the custom HT1080 screen recovered 58% of sensitisers seen for each ligand in the A375 genome-wide screen, it is striking that this increases to 93% (i.e. 112 out of 121) when considering all screens irrespective of G4 ligand, suggesting remarkable consistency when comparing G4 ligand effects globally. Differences in individual ligand sensitives may arise from variances in cellular uptake and dose, for\_example, the GI20 dose of PhenDC3 is ten-fold higher for A375 compared to HT1080; G4 ligand-dependent molecular preference for G-tetrad end binding ("

        ). These points plus differences in protein knockdown efficiency,
        especially in A375 cells, may contribute to the differences in G4 ligand
        growth inhibition in our siRNA experiments. In the siRNA experiments,
        the G4 ligand-induced growth inhibition of both A375 and HT1080 appear
        not to follow a ‘typical’ dose response where higher concentrations lead
        to greater effects. This may in part be due to there being an optimum G4
        ligand dose for a particular gene loss leading to enhanced cell death.
        Indeed, it is thought that lower drug concentrations better fall within
        a ‘synthetic lethality window’ (

        not dependent on the particular gene lost and/or be due to other
        off-target effects. This is also supported by the experiments in

        Gene Ontology terms (Biological Process and Molecular Function) for
        significantly depleted genes upon G4 ligand treatment. Specifically, a
        right-sided (Enrichment) test based on the hyper-geometric distribution
        was performed on the corresponding Entrez gene IDs for each gene list
        and the Bonferroni adjustment (p<0.05) was applied to correct for

        IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP) were used. The Kappa-statistics score threshold was
        set to 0.4 and GO term fusion was used to diminish redundancy of terms
        shared by similar proteins. Other parameters include: GO level intervals
        (3–8 genes) and Group Merge (50%). Protein domains were investigated
        using DAVID (v6.8) to integrate GENE3D crystallographic data and PFAM

Cells were transfected with either targeting or non-targeting control siRNAs using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 13778150) and OptiMEM reduced serum medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (reagent protocol 2013) alongside a non-transfected control. 24 hr after transfection, cells were trypsinised, counted and re-plated in media supplemented with PDS, PhenDC3 or DMSO vehicle control (minimum two biological replicates per condition) in a 48-well plate format (seeding density - 8,000 cells per well A375; 4,000 cells per well HT1080). Cell growth was monitored for 144 hr using IncuCyteZOOM live cell analysis (Sartorius) and cell confluency calculated as a percentage of the well area covered. Scans were performed every 3 hr; nine scans per well. To monitor protein levels, cells transfected simultaneously with the same siRNA-reagent mixture were harvested 48 hr and 144 hr after transfection, by cell scraping and lysed on ice (30 min) with RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitor\_+EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat # 8990). Lysates were analysed by capillary electrophoresis via the Protein Simple Wes platform according to manufacturer’s protocol with antibodies summarised in the key resource table above. Lysates from non-transfected and siRNA-treated (targeting and non-targeting) samples were probed with antibodies against BRCA1 (Cell Signalling Technology, cat # 4970-CST), TOP1 (Abcam, cat # AB109374), GAR1 (NovusBio cat #NBP2-31742) or DDX42 (Abcam cat #AB80975), plus anti-beta actin antibody (mouse Merck cat # A5441; rabbit cat # 4970-CST) by multiplexing. For non-targeting and targeting lysates, the area of the desired band was normalised to beta-actin and then normalised to the protein level in the non-targeting sample, for three (48 hr after transfection lysates) or two independent Wes runs (144 hr after transfection). Protein depletion is expressed as an average of these normalised values. All lysates were used at a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL and antibody dilutions as follows: BRCA1 1:50; TOP1 1:250; GAR1 1:100; DDX42 1:250; rabbit-actin 1:500; mouse-actin 1:250."

        200 μL of 10 μM oligonucleotide were prepared in assay buffer and
        annealed as described above. CD spectra were recorded on an Applied
        Photo-physics Chirascan CD spectropolarimeter using a 1 mm path length
        quartz cuvette. CD measurements were performed at 298 K over a range of
        200–320 nm using a response time of 0.5 s, 1 nm pitch and 0.5 nm
        bandwidth. The recorded spectra represent a smoothed average of three
        scans, zero-corrected at 320 nm (Molar ellipticity
