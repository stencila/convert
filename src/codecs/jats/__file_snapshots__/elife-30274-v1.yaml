        In 2012, Lin et al. reported results that the c-Myc transcription
        factor, a potent oncogene that is frequently overexpressed in a large
        percentage of cancers, globally amplifies the expression of actively
        transcribed genes, opposed to regulating specific target genes. Using

        4.70, and 580 silent genes with a median expression of 0.032, for serum
        lot one. For active genes, 75% of the genes increased from 0 hr to 1 hr,
        68% increased from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 59% increased from 1 hr to 24 hr
        upon c-Myc induction. This corresponds to a 1.11, 1.50, and 1.36 times
        increase in median expression, respectively (

        increased from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 50% increased from 1 hr to 24 hr,
        corresponding to a 1.19 and 1.13 times increase, and a 0.05 times

        of increase among the conditions (

        ). This compares to the original study that identified 755 active genes
        with a median expression of 7.06, and 514 silent genes with a median
        expression of 0.00 (more than half the silent genes did not have a
        reported expression value). Active genes in the original study,
        increased 91% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 96% from 0 hr to 24 hr, and 87% from 1
        hr to 24 hr upon c-Myc induction, corresponding to a 1.23, 2.45, and
        1.99 times increase in median expression, respectively. Silent genes in
        the original study, increased 23% from 0 hr to 1 hr, 29% from 0 hr to 24
        hr, and 30% from 1 hr to 24 hr, with the median expression unchanged
        among conditions. In addition, we further examined the extent of overlap
        of active and silent genes between the original study and this
        replication attempt. Of the 1212 genes that were interrogated in both
        studies, 88.8% (603/679) of the active genes we identified in serum lot
        one were also active in the original study (90.1% (612/679) for serum
        lot two). For silent genes, 96.4% (456/473) of the genes we identified
        as silent in serum lot one were common with the silent genes identified
        in the original study (95.8% (453/473) for serum lot two).

        To test whether active genes, as well as silent genes, increased
        expression during c-Myc induction we performed the confirmatory analysis
        as outlined in the Registered Report (

          - 'Blum et al., 2015'

        ). This analysis differed from what was reported in the original study
        by analyzing the data as paired instead of unpaired. As suggested during
        peer review of the Registered Report, this is because expression of the
        same gene, analyzed across different conditions, is not independent (

        ). We performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on active genes comparing
        expression at 0 hr to 1 hr, 0 hr to 24 hr, and 1 hr to 24 hr, which were
        statistically significant for cells grown in both lots of serum (

        content:
          - Table 1

        ). The same comparisons were performed on silent genes, which were also
        statistically significant, with the exception of the silent gene
        comparison of 1 hr to 24 hr for serum lot one. Considering this was not
        the test reported in the original study, we conducted these paired
        analyses on the original data to provide a direct comparison. For both
        active and silent genes c-Myc induction resulted in statistically
        significant increases in expression, with the exception of the silent
        gene comparison from 0 hr to 1 hr (

        ). This is in contrast to the results of the unpaired tests that were
        reported in the original study where active genes were reported to have
        a statistically significant increase in expression and silent genes were
        reported as not statistically significant for all comparisons. We
        conducted an exploratory unpaired analysis on the replication data for
        comparison, which resulted in statistically significant differences
        among the active gene comparisons as well as half of the silent gene
        comparisons (

        Importantly, though, the question of whether the change in expression
        among active genes is different than silent genes has not been tested.
        This would require a separate test on their difference (

        ). To test whether active genes increased in expression during c-Myc
        induction more than silent genes, we performed an exploratory analysis
        on the difference in expression of active genes during c-Myc induction
        (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr) compared to the difference in expression of
        silent genes over that same period (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr). For both
        the original and replication data, there was a statistically significant
        increase in expression of active genes compared to silent genes (

        ). This suggests that active genes and silent genes do not have similar
        rates of expression upon c-Myc induction. To summarize, for this
        experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the
        original study and suggest that while both active and silent genes
        increased in expression upon c-Myc induction, the rate of increase was
        different.

        The original study and this replication attempt used the same criteria
        to characterize a gene as silent or active, but there are many negative
        consequences of dichotomizing continuous variables, such as information
        loss, especially with a small gene set (

        ). Papers published after the original study took an unbiased view by
        collecting comprehensive RNA-sequencing data to assess if the
        transcriptional effects of c-Myc were direct or indirect, concluding
        c-Myc activates and represses transcription of discrete gene sets, which
        in turn leads to induced RNA amplification (

        ). Furthermore, Sabò and colleagues also used NanoString technology to
        quantify a subset of the differentially expressed genes identified by
        RNA-seq and observed similar results that revealed upward shifts in gene
        expression upon c-Myc induction (

        ). However, instead of dichotomizing genes as active or silent, gene
        expression data was presented as continuous. Similarly, we presented the
        digital gene expression data generated during this replication attempt
        as continuous, which illustrates a general pattern of overall increased
        gene expression following c-Myc induction (

        interrogated in this study and may or may not reflect how the entire
        transcriptome of P493-6 cells respond to c-Myc induction.

        Wilcoxon signed-rank test using the method proposed by Pratt to handle
        zero differences (

        ), with additional exploratory analysis performed using the Wilcoxon
        rank sum test as reported in the original study and a Wilcoxon rank sum
        test on the difference in expression of active genes during c-Myc
        induction (e.g. from 0 hr to 24 hr) compared to the difference in
        expression of silent genes over that same period (e.g. from 0 hr to 24
        hr). Data were checked to ensure assumptions of statistical tests were
        met. When described in the results, the Bonferroni correction, to
        account for multiple testings, was applied to the alpha error by
        dividing the uncorrected value (.05) by the number of tests performed.
        Although the Bonferroni method is conservative, it was accounted for in
        the power calculations to ensure sample size was sufficient. In cases
        where the number of groups were three and the sample sizes were evenly
        distributed among the groups, Fisher's LSD test was performed resulting

      - "The number of flasks, and thus cells, was increased when tetracycline was added to P493-6 cells to account for the cells not proliferating during this period (i.e. there were two Flask B’s as described in the Registered Report, which were pooled prior to seeding). The proposed statistical analysis for the western blot analysis (Protocol 1) described in the Registered Report was not performed since the levels of normalized c-Myc at time 0 hr was at the limit of detection. The number of genes analyzed in the original study, and thus listed in the Registered Report, was reported incorrectly as 1388 instead of 1338 (data shared by original authors). NanoString analysis was conducted using the nCounter RCC Collector Worksheet instead of nSolver Analysis software. Additionally, the statistical tests reported in\_Figure\_3F of the original study incorrectly described the comparisons as between 0 hr and 1 hr instead of between 0 hr and 24 hr (scripts shared by original authors). The corrected values are described above for comparisons and used in the meta-analysis. Additional materials and instrumentation not listed in the Registered Report, but needed during experimentation are also listed."
