        Cyanobacteria, a group of prokaryotes, are well known for their ability
        to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. They survive in different niche
        environmental conditions ranging from seawater to deserts and greatly
        contribute to the global primary production [

        ]. This ability to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide and
        photosynthetically convert it to biomass makes cyanobacteria leading
        candidates in biofuel research. The nitrogen fixing variety of some
        cyanobacteria contribute significantly to the nitrogen cycle [

        Current methods of prediction of gene essentiality have certain
        limitations. For example, the metabolic modelling based methods are
        applicable only for the metabolic genes. The computational approaches
        used for predicting gene essentiality based on orthologs do not include
        all the cyanobacterial genera. In experimental methods, the experimental
        techniques become arduous, especially while considering multiple growth
        conditions. Further, it is difficult to simulate all experimental
        conditions that cyanobacteria may encounter in nature during evolution.
        This is true especially for real life stress conditions and selection
        pressures which decide gene essentiality. In this study, we present gene
        conservation index as a quick method to assess gene essentiality. Our
        dataset comprises of phylogenetic profiles for 23,643 non-redundant
        genes from cyanobacterial species of diverse genera. Apart from insights
        on gene essentiality, the data provides useful clues on co-evolution of
        genes that may be helpful in gene annotation.

        from partial domain matches. All proteins that satisfy these criteria
        are listed as hits and omitted from being considered as query sequences
        subsequently. A “1” in the profile indicates the presence of at least
        one hit in the genome while a “0” indicates the absence.

        Over twenty-three thousand phylogenetic profiles were constructed by
        using non-redundant protein coding genes from cyanobacteria as query.
        The protein sequences were searched against 120 cyanobacterial genomes
        of diverse genera using BLASTP. The database of phylogenetic profiles
        created not only contains the query IDs but also the hit IDs and
        therefore can be searched by UniProt IDs / PATRIC IDs of proteins in any
        of the 120 microorganisms (

        result in profiles for organisms added in later stages (

        ). Since only 20 cyanobacteria species were used for profile creation,
        some of the protein coding genes from the other cyanobacteria may not be
        found in our database but that number is expected to be small. Also, the
        genes missing in our profiles are expected to be unique genes present
        only in a limited number of cyanobacteria.

        It was of interest to check for potential redundancy in the query
        protein sequences used in construction of profiles. To that end, we
        performed an all-against-all BLASTP search of the query sequences used
        in profiles formation and find that 1904 of the ~ 10
      - type: Superscript

        . This accounts for ~ 8% redundancy in our profiles. These potentially
        redundant sequence pairs formed separate profiles in our dataset as they
        did not satisfy the criteria of query coverage and score density. BLASTP
        hits may also result from partial domain matches that cannot be
        considered as a hit. Another potential reason for this to happen is that
        such protein pairs may actually be evolutionarily related with common
        function but may have undergone substantial evolutionary divergence. To
        test this hypothesis, we checked if (i) the profiles are mutually
        exclusive with high Hamming distance and (ii) the divergence of the two
        proteins correlates with the evolution of the organisms. To test mutual
        exclusivity, we computed modified Hamming distance of such pairs of
        profiles by ignoring the genomes where both genes are absent. This
        analysis shows that indeed a large fraction of the potentially redundant
        pairs are mutually exclusive. This can be visualized on the principle
        component analysis (PCA) plot (

        functionally similar proteins largely correlates with the evolution of
        the organisms (

        ). To exemplify, profiles with query UniProt Ids B1XMD2 and B7K1R1 are
        mutually exclusive. Both the proteins are involved in the catalysis of
        the second and third steps (cysteine ligation, (EC:6.3.2.5), and
        decarboxylation, (EC:4.1.1.36)) in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA)

        related subset of organisms suggesting that the divergence of the
        protein sequences correlates with the evolution of the organism.

        About 35% of all the query genes (8,280 profiles) are semi-conserved.
        These include genes involved in niche functions such as nitrogen
        fixation, defense response to viruses, response to stress conditions,
        etc. Although only semi-conserved at the level of cyanobacterial phylum,
        some of these genes are conserved in their respective clades and this
        needs to be examined further.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        About 61% of the query genes (14,370 profiles) are unique and present
        only in < 10% of the organism clusters. A large fraction of these
        proteins are not annotated. It is likely that these proteins are
        conserved only at species level performing a highly niche function.

        We have specifically analyzed for the circadian clock genes which are
        involved in the regulation of global gene expression patterns,
        interactions with the genes of key metabolic pathways, the timing of
        cell division and in chromosome compaction [

        organisms which removes the bias introduced by the overrepresentation of

        remove errors introduced due to incomplete genome sequencing. A large

        unique genes are functionally annotated. These proteins are typically
        unique to specific genera which may not have been well studied. At the

        functionally annotated.

        genes (494) in the reduced dataset.

      - >-
        Twelve representative CCGs are shown in (A) PCA plot where principle
        component analysis (PCA) of all the semi-conserved profiles (genes) was
        performed to plot only the representative genes and (B) Heatmap. Genes
        of a cluster are color-coded in the two plots. Phylogenetic profiles of
        genes are clustered using hierarchical clustering with Hamming distance
        as the metric, average linkage and a cutoff of 0.15. The representative
        phylogenetic profiles (genes) are then clustered again to depict their
        relatedness. Organism clusters in the heatmap are based on their genome
        profiles depicting their evolutionary relationships. In the heatmap,
        grey and black colors indicate presence and absence of the gene,
        respectively. Details of the clusters are as follows: Cluster 1:
        transposase enzymes, Cluster 2: acetamidase/formamidase enzymes, Cluster
        3: nitrogen fixation genes, Cluster 4: SH3 domain protein, Cluster 5:
        sodium symporter proteins, Cluster 6: phosphate ABC transporter
        proteins, Cluster 7: ATP synthase subunit enzymes, Cluster 8:
        hydrogenase enzymes, Cluster 9: CRISPR associated proteins, Cluster 10:
        TPR repeat-containing proteins, Cluster 11: gas vesicle proteins,
        Cluster 12: ABC transporter proteins.

    content:

        We present systematic analysis of phylogenetic profiles of
        cyanobacterial genes. Clustering of the organisms helps prepare a
        reduced dataset of genomes, which is an important step in the entire
        analysis. Further, we propose gene conservation index (GCI) as a ready
        measure to predict gene essentiality in the cyanobacterial phylum. A
        large majority of the conserved genes (this study) have been found to be
        essential (Rubin et al, 2015). The CCG, obtained upon clustering of the
        semi-conserved genes, provide useful clues on the function of
        unannotated genes. We also present useful ways of visualization of the
        data in the form of heatmap and principal component analysis (PCA). We
        believe that the data presented here would serve as a useful resource to
        the scientific community.
