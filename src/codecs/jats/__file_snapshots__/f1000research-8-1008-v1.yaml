        The results of the present study showed that PCN does induce cell death
        in Raji cells as also seen in our previous report

        . Similarly, other also demonstrated that PCN of

        . Therefore, efforts to inhibit excessive host cell damage induced by
        PCN are imminent.

        Further results of the present study demonstrated that anti-PCN IgY
        antibodies specific to PCN significantly reduce the ability of this
        virulence to induce Raji cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. Whilst
        no previous studies showing prevention of PCN-induced cell death by
        antigen-specific IgY have yet been reported to our knowledge, the
        present results are supported by the fact that antigen-specific IgY
        antibodies did prevent

        . The exact mechanism by which antigen-specific IgY antibodies inhibited
        PCN-induced Raji cell death seen in the present study remains unclear,
        however. Our previous study indicated that PCN induced Raji cell death
        via a caspase 3-activation pathway

            relation: bibr
      - >-
        . It seems plausible, therefore, that PCN-IgY antibody complexes may
        fail to activate Raji cell-derived caspase 3 and hence, inhibit cell
        death. However, more studies are required to delineate this speculation.
