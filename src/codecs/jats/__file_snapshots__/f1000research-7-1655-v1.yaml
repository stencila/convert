        Peer review is the practice of subjecting a scholarly article, such as a
        research paper submitted to a journal, to scrutiny or review by others
        ('peers') who are experts in the same field. Generally, if the author of
        the article addresses the concerns raised during peer review to the
        satisfaction of an editor, the article is accepted for publication. The
        peer review process produces a trail of documents, which can include:
        different versions of the article; the reviewer reports (with or without
        the name of the reviewer); responses by the author to the reports; and
        various letters (including cover letters from the author and decision
        letters from the editor). It is also possible for an article to go
        through two or more rounds of peer review, which increases the number of
        documents generated.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        Traditionally the documents generated during the peer review process
        were only ever seen by the author, the editor and the reviewers, but a
        small number of publishers now publish some peer review materials
        alongside articles. Moreover, support for this practice has been slowly
        gaining momentum, driven by a wish to increase transparency and provide
        credit for peer reviewers (

        ). There were 10 journals identified in the PMC corpus that archive some
        peer review materials. These journals take a variety of different
        approaches, which results in differing levels of discoverability for
        these materials. Additionally, some journals were identified as
        publishing peer review materials but not consistently archiving them in
        a repository.

        Here we report the findings of a workshop, held at the BMA in London, UK
        on July 6, 2018, at which representatives from publishers, PubMed
        Central (PMC)/Europe PMC, and Crossref discussed the practical
        challenges involved in publishing peer review materials. We focus on
        what has to happen after a publisher decides to start publishing peer
        review materials, and discuss how to do this in a way that is
        sustainable, improves discoverability, and supports machine readability
        and archiving. We do not discuss the relative merits of the different
        approaches to peer review that have emerged over the past decade,
        notably the many different flavours of 'open peer review' (

        relevant to most if not all of these approaches.

      - What are peer review materials?
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        As mentioned above, peer review materials can include: the reviewer
        reports (with or without the reviewer name); responses by the author to
        the reports; and various letters (including cover letters from the
        author and decision letters from the editor). Some articles go through
        two or more rounds of peer review, which increases the number of
        documents generated. While each document is usually accompanied by a
        date, other metadata concerning the correspondence can be highly
        variable. For example, peer review reports and editors decision letters
        may or may not include names of reviewers or editors, or their ORCID
        IDs; the individual materials may or may not have DOIs. In subscription
        journals it is also possible for peer review materials to appear in
        front of or behind the paywall.

        Publishers are approaching the publication of peer review materials in a
        number of ways. The aims of this group were not to prescribe what should
        be done from an editorial point of view, but to enable what is published
        to be found by readers and machines alike. Prior to the workshop, data
        were collected from each publisher attending and we found the following
        materials are published:
  - type: List
    order: unordered
    items:
      - type: ListItem

        Some journals also provide appeal and resubmission information
        (including previous versions of the article, dates, and actors
        involved).

    content:
      - >-
        In some cases publishers make peer review materials available as a
        single PDF with versioned reports linked to specific revisions of the
        article. Other publishers create separate artifacts, each with unique
        DOIs, and still others edit and amalgamate various reports into one
        narrative. The variety can be found in the meeting notes and a table
        filled out before the meeting (See

        After collecting these data, representatives from each of the identified
        publishers were contacted to attend a workshop in London on July 6,
        2018; all but one publisher was able to attend. Further publisher
        representatives were invited following communication with ASAPbio –
        these publishers are embarking on this practice. Crossref, Europe PMC
        and PMC were also represented at this meeting, as downstream recipients
        of this content or the metadata related to it. Journal representatives
        expanded on the data previously collected and shared details on how they
        collect and publish peer review materials, how these artifacts are
        represented in the ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015 Journal Article Tag Suite
        (JATS) document standard (these principles can be applicable to other
        DTDs), and whether they send relevant metadata to Crossref. Crossref
        shared details of their schema extension to represent this form of
        content (

        ). As downstream recipients of peer review materials, PMC and Europe PMC
        presented the perspective of archives that collaborate with journals to
        ensure that content is being captured in a sustainable and consistent
        format that fosters long-term preservation and access to the scholarly
        record.  Understanding the goals of, workflows, and limitations on each
        stakeholder allowed the group to refine the scope of the discussion and
        its outcomes.

      - Peer review materials need to “stand alone”
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        In order to advance the transparency and recognition of peer review
        materials, we agreed these peer review materials need to stand alone
        from the main article for the purposes of, for example, credit and
        citation. Ideally, each content item should have its own DOI (as per the
        recently enhanced Crossref schema). We identified three levels of
        achieving this, with level 1 being the basic and least preferred option,
        but probably currently the most achievable and pragmatic:
  - type: List

          - type: Paragraph
            content:
              - >-
                Peer review materials are attached to the article as a single or
                numerous PDFs. Whether these materials are pulled together into
                one document or attached as separate documents, there should be
                some defined mechanism in the JATS XML tagging that would
                support the capture of any available metadata and identify these
                files in a machine-readable and interoperable way for publishers
                to tag this content appropriately.

                Peer review materials are appended to the article within the
                full text (so all is machine readable) as a sub-article
                component of the XML.

                Peer review materials are full-text XML “articles” or
                “commentaries” in their own right that link bidirectionally to
                the main article.

      - Required metadata versus rich metadata
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        Whether the material is provided as a PDF(s) attachment to the main
        article, or as a full-text XML sub-article or separate article,
        important metadata can be attached to the item in a machine-readable
        way, and DOIs can be applied. What types of peer review information are
        available is dependent on the publisher’s peer review policy, for
        instance whether reviewers and editors are named, whether the peer
        review material carries the same license as the main article or takes
        another form, and what items constitute the peer review materials.
        Additional metadata fields, such as dates of review and date of review
        publication and the inclusion of ORCID IDs for reviewers and editors
        will also be subject to publisher policies and workflows. However, all
        of this material can be added to the item in a machine-readable way.
        Even if the actual content is not published in full-text XML format, the
        metadata can (and should) be.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        The topic of licensing of the peer review materials was briefly
        discussed at the workshop but ultimately left out of the remit of this
        group because the JATS tagging schema would allow for different
        licensing information to be added for these items or to retain that of
        the main article, as a publisher chooses.

        While a few of the publishers had processes in place to prepare the peer
        review content automatically or within a few minutes, others spend 20–40
        minutes per article. In such cases, the tasks that are attributed to
        this time include the following:

        Where time is spent—whether in the editorial or production
        process—depends on the publisher workflow. Regardless of workflow, the
        overlap in tasks identified provides evidence of the potential value of
        updating the infrastructure of submission systems to account for and
        streamline these efforts. Coordination between publishers and submission
        systems could minimize the time spent “stitching together” peer review
        materials into a publishable format.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        In addition to time and workflow hurdles, another major challenge noted
        by those publishers without their own hosting platforms, was the actual
        publication process and online hosting of peer review materials. Many
        publishers identified that some online hosts were not able to manage
        this new content type. As a result, peer review materials are being
        captured in supplementary material sections because alternative options
        are not available. In such cases, it becomes more difficult to capture
        any relevant associated metadata in a meaningful way for the peer review
        materials or to make this valuable content easily discoverable.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        These challenges are common for publishers in that most of the
        established submission systems and hosting platforms were designed and
        built many years ago and may be slow to accommodate new requirements.
        Coordinated communication with these platforms regarding the workflows
        around publishing peer review materials may result in more satisfactory
        and generic approaches to accommodating publication of peer review
        materials.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        There are internal challenges of cost control issues that also need to
        be accounted for, and the publication of a single PDF is often more
        achievable financially based on current systems than producing full-text
        XML. However, the attachment of machine-readable metadata to that PDF
        should be within reach, especially if the submission systems and hosting
        platforms can build these requirements into their products.

        To this list, the JATS4R working group on “Article publication and
        history dates” added pre-print. The JATS4R draft recommendation advises
        that if the publisher publishes a revision of any of these stages, the
        subsequent revisions should be labelled with suffixes, as follows:
        “-r1”, “-r2”, etc. (

        If the peer review materials reference content in a specific version of
        an article, that link between peer review materials and correct version
        should be captured in the metadata for clarity. Managing the
        associations between peer review materials and article version is
        essential for journals that make multiple versions of a paper publicly
        available, to ensure the archival record is accurate and that the
        process transparent. For example, if a journal publishes three versions
        of an article, any related peer review materials should be associated
        with the appropriate version. It should not be left to a reader to
        determine if a peer review report or decision letter relates to the
        first version, the second version, or the third version.

        We also propose that publisher web platforms and archives display peer
        review materials (or links to peer review materials) in a clearly
        labeled peer review section. This practice will help ensure that not
        only are the journal processes transparent but that the content itself
        is easy to find and navigate to, regardless of how a journal chooses to
        make them available.

        This proposal is intended to lay the groundwork for the publication and
        archiving of peer review materials across publishers and publication
        models, providing flexible options to meet different journal needs and
        workflows. Moving forward, there is a need for continued collaboration
        and discussion as peer review models and workflows evolve. As the goals
        of these peer review efforts are more clearly defined across the
        publishing and academic communities, certain models may lend themselves
        more readily to supporting those desired outcomes. Continued efforts to
        identify the most critical needs of each user group should be explored
        through ongoing efforts such as ASAPbio and FORCE11. In turn, these
        needs can inform the technical solutions and recommendations going
        forward.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        Further technical discussions should not be placed on hold in the
        interim, though. As publishing peer review materials practices grow,
        there is a pressing need for industry-wide solutions now. We would like
        to see the XML recommendations from this group be converted to a JATS4R
        recommendation on the publishing of peer review materials. Similarly, it
        would be of value to the community for Crossref and JATS to coordinate
        efforts and ensure some level of metadata alignment for peer review
        materials that would reduce costs to publishers and minimize barriers to
        implementation.
  - type: Paragraph
    content:
      - >-
        This type of coordination between publishers, archives, and other
        organizations that support the scholarly communication enterprise is
        critical to ensuring that the needs of the whole community are being
        met. Past experience has taught us that making content available is just
        the first step toward increasing transparency. Doing so in a flexible,
        consistent, and meaningful way is imperative in making certain that the
        available material is also discoverable and that long-term preservation
        of the content can be supported. Implementing the next steps through
        community-driven recommendations in a sustainable way will be important
        in increasing transparency and rigor of the scientific record.
